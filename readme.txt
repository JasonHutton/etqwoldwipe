1. About
================================
ETQW Old Wipe is intended to assist ETQW mappers, players, and server admins
in making sure they have the latest version of maps for ETQW, as easily and
painlessly as possible.
MD5 hashes are used to compare a given file against an existing hash,
to determine if they're identical or not.
While this can be done with any run of the mill md5sum application, 
ETQW Old Wipe seeks to make this a simpler process.
ETQW Old Wipe is a Windows-only application at present, and requires
Microsoft's .NET Framework, available here: http://www.microsoft.com/NET/

2. Features
================================
* Detects ETQW's gamepath and userpath automatically.
* Calculates md5 hashes for detected *.pk4 and *.mega files.
* Compares calculated md5 hashes against a list of md5 hashes.
* Can load md5 hashes from your harddrive, or from the internet.
* Can save a calculated list of md5 hashes.
* Delete pk4 and mega files who's md5 hashes don't match the ones listed.

3. Installation
================================
None required. Just run it.
Requires Microsoft's .NET Framework: http://www.microsoft.com/NET/

4. Known Issues
================================
* ETQW Old Wipe won't pick up new files after its first search.
  Simply restart the program to work around this, for now.
